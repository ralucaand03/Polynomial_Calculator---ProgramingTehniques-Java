## ✅ JUnit Testing
To ensure the correctness and reliability of the polynomial operations, the project includes comprehensive **JUnit tests**. These tests cover:
- **Addition**: Verifies the sum of two polynomials.
- **Subtraction**: Checks the difference between two polynomials.
- **Multiplication**: Tests the product of two polynomials.
- **Division**: Confirms the accuracy of quotient and remainder.
- **Derivation**: Validates the derivative computation of a polynomial.
- **Integration**: Ensures correct integration of polynomials.

### Running the Tests
1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**).
2. Navigate to the `/test` directory.
3. Run the JUnit test suite to execute all test cases:
   - In IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click the `test` folder and select **Run All Tests**.
   - In Eclipse: Right-click the `test` package and choose **Run As > JUnit Test**.

By using JUnit, the project ensures robust functionality and maintains a high level of reliability across all polynomial operations. ✅
